# Assignment 4
In this chapter, there is no typical assignment but we will use it to get familiar with plotting functions in R, in particular ggplot2. Weâ€™ll need them in the following chapters, so feel free to play around and get used to the syntax. You can also check out the graphs from the previous chapter.

Having read this chapter, you have already understood the risk of confusing correlation with causation. On the internet, you can find many examples of spurious correlations. Spurious correlations are correlations that appear to be causal but are in fact not. The reason could be that there is a confounding factor or that two variables happen to be statistically associated just by coincidence.

Do some internet research and find a spurious correlation. Then, try to replicate it in R using ggplot2. Here you can find a well written introduction to ggplot2 written by Megan Hall and the official documentation also contains a lot of useful tips. It does not to be exactly the same plot but it should convey the message that both variables correlate.

```{r}
#| include: false
#load libraries
library(ggplot2)
```
# Solution

It is common for unrelated variables to appear to be correlated by coincidence. This is known as spurious correlation. The "Spending on science, space, and technology" in the United States is one example of this, as it shows a surprisingly strong correlation with the "Suicides by hanging, strangulation and suffocation" over time. While there is a significant positive correlation between these two variables, there is no causal relationship.

![Spurious Correlation Example](../../assets/img/Spurious.png)
Generating random data to show spurious correlation
```{r}
# Generating random data
set.seed(123)
n <- 100
x <- rnorm(n)  # Generating random data for variable X
y <- x + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 0.2)  # Generating Y correlated with X

# Create a dataframe
data <- data.frame(X = x, Y = y)

# Plotting the spurious correlation using ggplot2
ggplot(data, aes(x = X, y = Y)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Spurious Correlation",
       x = "Variable X",
       y = "Variable Y") +
  theme_minimal()

```
"X" and "Y" are two random variables in this example. Random noise is added to 'X' to generate 'Y', resulting in a correlation between the two. 'X' and 'Y', however, have no meaningful relationship, despite their visual correlation in the plot. This illustrates how unrelated variables can still produce spurious correlations.
