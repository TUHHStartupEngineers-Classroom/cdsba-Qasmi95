A company sells a SaaS (Software as a service) to business clients that chose to subscribe to one of the three subscription levels, Starter, Premium or Elite, which provide different features at different price points (more storage and other capabilities). Starter has the least functionality, while Elite includes the most features.\n\n  Now imagine, you are working as an analyst for that company and are asked to examine the relationship between follow-up calls to the clients and their satisfaction with the product and service. Follow-up calls are voluntary and are just to help the client with possible problems and so on. Satisfaction is measured on a weekly basis by surveying the clients.\n\n  In the data, you find three variables: satisfaction, follow_ups and subscription. Perform the following steps:\n\n    + regress satisfaction on follow_ups\n\n    + regress satisfaction on follow_ups and account for subscription\n\n* Compare the coefficients and find a possible explanation.\n\n* Plot the data. Youâ€™ll find a similar plot in this chapter, that you can copy some lines from.\n\n\n\n\n## Assignment 5.1\n\n::: {.cell hash='05_dag_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_5ff3f601cb0d23e4da472c2cb1df3558'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Define the DAG for the parking spot example\nparking_dag <- dagify(\n  sales ~ parking_spots,\n  sales ~ location,\n  parking_spots ~ location,\n  coords = list(x = c(sales = 1, parking_spots = 3, location = 2),\n                y = c(sales = 0, parking_spots = 0, location = 1))\n)\n\n\n# Plot the DAG with default ggplot2 theme\nggdag(parking_dag, text = FALSE) +\n  geom_dag_point() +\n  geom_dag_text(color = \"red\") +\n  geom_dag_edges(edge_color = \"black\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05_dag_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n## Assignment 5.2.1\n\n::: {.cell hash='05_dag_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_68a1b17a986f7bf1233cbcd236c744de'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the data file customer_sat.rds\ndata <- readRDS(\"data/customer_sat.rds\")\n\n# 1.

Furthermore, the subscription level coefficients imply that higher subscription tiers (Premium and Premium+) have a positive impact on satisfaction when compared to some assumed base level (possibly Starter, which is not explicitly included as a variable).\n\n## Assignment 5.4\n\n::: {.cell hash='05_dag_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_cd7ce36abc50d67b626f90ff7fe79f26'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a DAG for the relationship between follow-up calls, satisfaction, and subscription\nsaas_dag <- dagify(\n  satisfaction ~ follow_ups,\n  satisfaction ~ subscription,\n  follow_ups ~ subscription,\n  coords = list(x = c(satisfaction = 1, follow_ups = 3, subscription = 2),\n                y = c(satisfaction = 0, follow_ups = 0, subscription = 1))\n)\n\n# Plot the DAG \nggdag(saas_dag, text = FALSE) +\n  geom_dag_point() +\n  geom_dag_text(color = \"red\") +\n  geom_dag_edges(edge_color = \"black\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05_dag_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::",
