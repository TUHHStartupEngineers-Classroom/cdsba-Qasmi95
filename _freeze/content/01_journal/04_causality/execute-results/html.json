The \"Spending on science, space, and technology\" in the United States is one example of this, as it shows a surprisingly strong correlation with the \"Suicides by hanging, strangulation and suffocation\" over time. While there is a significant positive correlation between these two variables, there is no causal relationship.\n\nExample taken from (https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)\n\n![Spurious Correlation Example](../../assets/img/Spurious.png)\nGenerating random data to show spurious correlation\n\n::: {.cell hash='04_causality_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_47e710e3dc4bede802b926152911c32c'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Generating random data\nset.seed(123)\nn <- 100\nx <- rnorm(n)  # Generating random data for variable X\ny <- x + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 0.2)  # Generating Y correlated with X\n\n# Create a dataframe\ndata <- data.frame(X = x, Y = y)\n\n# Plotting the spurious correlation using ggplot2\nggplot(data, aes(x = X, y = Y)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Spurious Correlation\",\n       x = \"Variable X\",\n       y = \"Variable Y\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](04_causality_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\"X\" and \"Y\" are two random variables in this example. Random noise is added to 'X' to generate 'Y', resulting in a correlation between the two. 'X' and 'Y', however, have no meaningful relationship, despite their visual correlation in the plot. This illustrates how unrelated variables can still produce spurious correlations.\n",
